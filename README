Purpose: This code is used to output counts of radiation emissions per second (cps) over a set timeframe with set time intervals. 

User Instruction: At the start of the program the user will be prompted to choose both a timeframe for measurement and an interval for which cps will be measured. The unit is seconds. 
The prompts are "How long would you like to run for?" and "At what interval?"
The program will then output cps for the user defined timeframes and intervals, along with corresponding timestamp for when the measurement finished. 
These data are stored in the file cps.csv, which is located in the home directory, /home/pi/cps.csv.

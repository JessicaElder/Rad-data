# Rad-data

This code is used to show the counts of radiation per second for a user-defined timeframe, sub-divided into user-defined intervals.

The program will prompt users to pick a timeframe and interval at the start of the program. The time unit is seconds. 

The program will run for that set amount of time and will then print the cps and a corresponding time stamp. These data are saved into a file called cps.csv in the home directory (/home/pi/cps.csv).
